				<outline text="For my morning coffee reading, I enjoyed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/11/29/the-new-luxury-vacation-being-dumped-in-the-middle-of-nowhere&quot;&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; by Ed Caesar about his short solo trek in the Anti-Atlas mountains of Morocco, and the delicious meal that capped the adventure. That reminded me of our Peace Corps hike to the volcanoes on Ambrym Island, which I wrote about in &lt;a href=&quot;http://mistersugar.com/2012/12/09/sea-food&quot;&gt;Sea food&lt;/a&gt;." created="Tue, 30 Nov 2021 18:31:15 GMT" type="outline"/>

It's a profile of two alumni on the island of St. Croix and how their commitment to the leatherback sea turtle connects their work. &lt;a href=&quot;https://alumni.duke.edu/magazine/articles/how-love-endangered-leatherback-turtles-brought-two-alumni-together&quot;&gt;Read it.&lt;/a&gt;" created="Mon, 29 Nov 2021 00:24:18 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="I added an acorn icon to the post below. I wish I could connect Drummer and &lt;a href=&quot;https://thenounproject.com/about/&quot;&gt;Noun Project&lt;/a&gt; so that I could grab an icon for my posts. Not that my three-step process to find an icon and save it to my server takes that much effort or time. " created="Fri, 12 Nov 2021 21:18:50 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="It's a beautiful fall day. The oak trees were raining acorns on our land. I can see yellow leaves outside of the Duke Health clinic where I'm waiting. My spouse is upstairs in surgery. I'm nervous. Earlier in the day, I felt depressed. Then I bought flowers, snap dragons for Erin, and a cinnamon roll from Weaver Street Market, only to walk to the parking lot just as a student pulled into the next space and along the side of my van. So I went for a flat white from my favorite coffee shop. Last night &lt;a href=&quot;https://smol.zuiker.com/2021/11/11/this-is-good.html&quot;&gt;we gave away our hens&lt;/a&gt;. We're deep into a driveway project that's created neighborhood tension. I'm a mess but life is great.

				<outline text="I tried the new Drummer feature to create a standalone page from an outline, and I asked a question about the instant outline tech. Dave took my question and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhLrVZrZi24&quot;&gt;turned it around&lt;/a&gt; as an added bit of functionality for that feature. I like being one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com/2021/11/06/160253.html?title=poetsAndPlumbers&quot;&gt;plumbers&lt;/a&gt; on this project.

				<outline text="Speaking of plumbers, the guys from Drain Express were back today to take care of the final pieces of the expensive project that's given this old house all new pipes out to the septic system. The last of the toilets is installed and flushing and the bathroom that Erin and I share is put together.  " created="Mon, 08 Nov 2021 22:11:26 GMT" type="outline"/>
