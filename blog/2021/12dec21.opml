Highlight was jumping off the Zodiac into 700 feet of blue water and hearing the loud singing of a couple of male humpback whales somewhere nearby.

So much fun, the first time in nearly a year since I've been out with the guys (a wide range of ages and accents). On my way home through Chapel Hill, passing people coming out of the churches on Franklin Street, I realized that soccer is my religion." created="Mon, 13 Dec 2021 03:02:59 GMT" type="outline" image="http://test.stor.im/img/football125.png"/>

A &lt;a href=&quot;http://mistersugar.com/index.php?q=vanuatu&quot;&gt;search&lt;/a&gt; of The Coconut Wireless, the Textpattern blog I wrote at mistersugar.com for 15 years, has even more mentions of Vanuatu,  123! If I could convert my Texpattern archives to opml outlines and do these searches in Daytona, perhaps there'd be a way for me to make a list, sort and categorize, and get closer to writing a memoir about my time as a Peace Corps Volunteer there." created="Sun, 12 Dec 2021 18:25:15 GMT" type="outline"/>

For instance, I  searched for Vanuatu and found five docs that include that name (of the country in which I served as a Peace Corps Volunteer).

The pot was bone dry and the kitchen reeked of smoke. Life lesson #37: don't walk away from the kitchen when coffee is on the stove." created="Sat, 04 Dec 2021 17:47:14 GMT" type="outline"/>

				<outline text="Yesterday, I noticed a smell in my office, something vaguely plastic-like but also floral. I was just rummaging in one of the cabinet drawers, with my head near the Meyer lemon tree that is in the corner for the winter, and I realized I've been smelling the flowers that bloomed last week. I wonder how many will develop into lemons. There are five golf ball-sized lemons that started as flowers this summer, when the potted tree was out in the garden." created="Fri, 03 Dec 2021 23:20:36 GMT" type="outline" image="http://test.stor.im/img/lemon2.png"/>

I sat down to eat a bowl of pasta, and since I was alone at the table, I started to read the article, which starts with a reference to a walkway built above a fig tree in Samoa. I was halfway in when I noticed a caption that mentioned &lt;b&gt;Meg Lowman&lt;/b&gt;, who was the author of the article (and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374162696&quot;&gt;memoir&lt;/a&gt; from which it was excerpted). It all made sense, because Meg is known for her research, conservation, education, and eco-tourism efforts in and among the treetops. I got to know Meg when she spoke at one of our ScienceOnline conferences and then became a member of the board of directors. She's amazing, and I can't wait to read her book." created="Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:44:39 GMT" type="outline"/>
				<outline text="I went to the office in Durham to work today. My usual office-hotel on the second floor was taken so I went up to the seventh floor and found an empty office. A few times during the day, on my way to the printer or the toilet, I looked out the window and saw a long tour bus parked outside the Carolina Theatre. Later, as I started the drive home, I noticed on the theater marquee that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.crowmedicine.com&quot;&gt;Old Crow Medicine Show&lt;/a&gt; is performing there tonight and tomorrow. I love that band; I've seen them a few times, including twice at the Cat's Cradle in Carrboro, where I saw OCMS co-founder &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.williewatson.com&quot;&gt;Willie Watson&lt;/a&gt; a couple of weeks ago." created="Fri, 03 Dec 2021 00:33:01 GMT" type="outline"/>
