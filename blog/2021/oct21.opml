I felt a responsibility to Dave and the other Drummer testers to keep looking for bugs, but this tool actually gave me a simple way to chronicle my days. I didn't blog as much as did when I first started blogging in 2000, but I blogged enough to feel that I was &lt;a href=&quot;http://zuiker.com/look-for-the-row-of-hearts&quot;&gt;noticing what I was noticing&lt;/a&gt;. So Drummer has been great for writing a blog." created="Thu, 07 Oct 2021 21:42:06 GMT"/>
